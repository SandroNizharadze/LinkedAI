## ðŸš€ Run with Docker

You can run the entire stack (Django, PostgreSQL, Ollama AI) with Docker for easy local development and sharing:

1. **Copy the example environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Or create your own .env file with the required variables
   ```

2. **Build and start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Apply migrations and create a superuser (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

4. **Access the app:**
   - Django app: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Admin: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)
   - Ollama API: [http://localhost:11434](http://localhost:11434)

5. **Stop the stack:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

**Note:**
- The first run may take a while as Docker pulls images and builds the containers.
- Ollama will need to download the llama3 model the first time it runs.
- All data is persisted in Docker volumes (`postgres_data`, `ollama_data`).
